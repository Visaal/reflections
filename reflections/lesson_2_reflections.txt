What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Creates hidden .git folder
Needed to be able to store meta data and track the changes made to files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is holding pen for files to be committed
Allows files to be grouped into logical chunks so commit makes sense


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By just adding files related to the logical change to the staging area and then commiting these only.
